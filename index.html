        <a href="./games.html">Top videogames</a>
        <p>A video game, also known as a computer game, is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user
            interface <br> or input device such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device to
            generate audiovisual feedback. <br> This feedback is most commonly shown on a video display device, such as
            a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. <br> Some computer games do not always depend on
            a graphics display; for example, text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype
            printers. <br> Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones,
            and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.</p>

        <h1>PLATFORMS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b> computergames</b></li>
            <p>Most computer games are PC games, referring to those that involve a player interacting with a personal
                computer (PC) connected to a video monitor. <br> Personal computers are not dedicated game platforms, so
                there may be differences running the same game on different hardware. Also, the openness allows <br>
                some features to developers like reduced software cost, increased flexibility, increased innovation,
                emulation, creation of modifications or mods, <br> open hosting for online gaming (in which a person
                plays a video game with people who are in a different household) and others. A gaming computer is a PC
                or laptop intended specifically for gaming, <br> typically using high-performance, high-cost components.
                In additional to personal computer gaming, there also exist games that work on mainframe computers and
                other similarly shared systems, <br> with users logging in remotely to use the computer</p>
            <li><b>Home console</b></li>
            <p>A console game is played on a home console, a specialized electronic device that connects to a common
                television set or composite video monitor. Home consoles are specifically designed to play games <br>
                using a dedicated hardware environment, giving developers a concrete hardware target for development and
                assurances of what features will be available, simplifying development compared to PC game development.
                <br> Usually consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same
                company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on
                different platforms. <br> It often comes with a specific game controller. Major console platforms
                include Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo.
            </p>
            <li><b>Handheld console</b></li>
            <p>A handheld game console is a small, self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in
                a user's hands. It features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons, joystick or other game
                controllers in a single unit. <br> Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost
                the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardware. Some
                handheld games from the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game. <br> In the 1990s and
                2000s, a number of handheld games used cartridges, which enabled them to be used to play many different
                games. The handheld console has waned in the 2010s as mobile device gaming has become a more dominant
                factor.</p>
            <li><b>Arcade video game</b></li>
            <p>An arcade video game generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic
                device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated
                cabinet which has one built-in console, <br> controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a CRT screen, and
                audio amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the
                theme of the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, <br> which the user
                typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display
                screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users
                typically sit to play. <br> In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of
                multiple games. In the 1980s, video arcades were businesses in which game players could use a number of
                arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, <br> but some movie theaters and
                family entertainment centers still have them.</p>
            <li><b>Mobile game</b></li>
            <p>With the introduction of smartphones and tablet computers standardized on the iOS and Android operating
                systems, mobile gaming has become a significant platform. <br> These games may use unique features of
                mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as accelerometers, global
                positing information and camera devices to support augmented reality gameplay.</p>
            <li><b>Cloud gaming</b></li>
            <p>Cloud gaming requires a minimal hardware device, such as a basic computer, console, laptop, mobile phone
                or even a dedicated hardware device connected to a display with good Internet connectivity that connects
                to hardware systems by the cloud gaming provider. <br> The game is computed and rendered on the remote
                hardware, using a number of predictive methods to reduce the network latency between player input and
                output on their display device. <br> For example, the Xbox Cloud Gaming and PlayStation Now platforms
                use dedicated custom server blade hardware in cloud computing centers.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The early history of the video game industry, following the first game hardware releases and through 1983,
            had little structure. Video games quickly took off during the golden age of arcade video games from the late
            1970s to early 1980s, <br> but the newfound industry was mainly composed of game developers with little
            business experience. This led to numerous companies forming simply to create clones of popular games to try
            to capitalize on the market. <br> Due to loss of publishing control and oversaturation of the market, the
            North American home video game market crashed in 1983, dropping from revenues of around $3 billion in 1983
            to $100 million by 1985. <br> Many of the North American companies created in the prior years closed down.
            Japan's growing game industry was briefly shocked by this crash but had sufficient longevity to withstand
            the short-term effects, <br> and Nintendo helped to revitalize the industry with the release of the Nintendo
            Entertainment System in North America in 1985. Along with it, Nintendo established a number of core
            industrial practices to prevent unlicensed game development and control game distribution on their platform,
            <br> methods that continue to be used by console manufacturers today. The industry remained more
            conservative following the 1983 crash, forming around the concept of publisher-developer dichotomies, and by
            the 2000s, <br> leading to the industry centralizing around low-risk, triple-A games and studios with large
            development budgets of at least $10 million or more.[90] The advent of the Internet brought digital
            distribution as a viable means <br> to distribute games, and contributed to the growth of more riskier,
            experimental independent game development as an alternative to triple-A games in the late 2000s and which
            has continued to grow as a significant portion of the video game industry.
