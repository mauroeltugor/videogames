        <p>A video game, also known as a computer game, is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user
            interface <br> or input device such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device to
            generate audiovisual feedback. <br> This feedback is most commonly shown on a video display device, such as
            a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. <br> Some computer games do not always depend on
            a graphics display; for example, text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype
            printers. <br> Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones,
            and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.</p>
